FIXME

# FIXME (Cleveland GiveCamp Project)
Remaining Work in `cgc-testing-template.php`
1. refactor as much as possible
2. sanitize any fields needing it
3. duplicate taxonomy functionality for other ones - left a couple out...

Stuff I Need
1. Help refactoring - I'm repeating myself a lot.
2. Help checking for missing sanitization/doing it better.
