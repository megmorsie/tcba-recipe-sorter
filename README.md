Remaining Work in `cgc-testing-template.php`
1. change from echos to return values for shortcode functionality
2. refactor as much as possible
3. sanitize any fields needing it
4. duplicate taxonomy functionality for other ones
5. rename file to something more appropriate

Remaining Work in `cgc-testing-plugin.php`
1. move `cgc-testing-template.php` functionality into shortcode instead of a page template
(remove existing page template functionality & consolidate files)

Stuff I Need
1. Help refactoring - I'm repeating myself a lot.
2. Help checking for missing sanitization/doing it better.
